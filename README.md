This is a fork of the TSRE project, modified by and for Trainsim.Com users.

Create a directory for your v0.8 executable, and download the folder of DLL's into that same directory (not in a subfolder) along with your settings file.

There are some new setting tokens included in the Settings.txt file.

          Modified hotkeys on View Menu to eliminate duplications on "T"
          
          Modified log.txt to include date and timestamp and added prefix "tsre"

v0.8.002: 
          Exposed static detail level (custom detail level) on signals
