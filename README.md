This is a fork of the TSRE project, modified by and for Trainsim.Com users.

Create a directory for your v0.8 executable, and download the folder of DLL's into that same directory (not in a subfolder) along with your settings file.

There are some new settings available, which are included in the Settings.txt file available here.



v0.8.003: 
          increased decimals available on Dynamic track
          modified hotkeys on View Menu to eliminate duplications on "T"
          modified log.txt to include timestamp
          modified color for patch and world object selection (was blue, now orange)
          
v0.8.002: 
          exposed static detail level (custom detail level) on signals
          yellow/grey TDB/TSection line height defined in Settings.txt
          Values for terrain brush size/intensity, and embankment size/cut/fill/radius defined in Settings.txt
          Always launch TSRE on primary monitor (fixes window loading error when using multiple monitors)
